# EmberVault

Local-first notes. No accounts. No cloud.

EmberVault is a dark-mode, macOS-inspired notes app that runs in the browser while keeping everything on your device. It’s built for speed, privacy, and a calm writing environment—without logins, sync, or tracking.

## What it is

- **Local-only notes** — your data stays on your device.
- **Two storage modes**
  - **Folder vault** (best on Chrome/Edge): notes live in a user-chosen folder on disk.
  - **Browser storage** (IndexedDB): quick setup and works across modern browsers.
- **Single workspace** organized with **folders + tags**.
- **Powerful editor**: block-based, Markdown-friendly, with code blocks, tables, checklists, quotes, dividers, and LaTeX math.
- **Fast navigation**: full-text search (filters + fuzzy), tabs, and split panes.
- **Right panel** for outline + metadata.
- **Favorites + Trash** (restore supported).

## Why it exists

This is a side project focused on exploring a polished local-first UX and modern web tooling. It’s built as a product-style prototype.

## Notes

- EmberVault is **offline-first** after the first load.
- Folder vault uses the browser’s folder permission model (Chrome/Edge best experience).
- No accounts. No tracking.
